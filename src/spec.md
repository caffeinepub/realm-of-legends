## Summary
**Goal:** Build "Realm of Legends", a 3D action RPG with character creation, open world exploration, real-time combat, questing, multiplayer features, crafting, and a player-driven economy.

**Planned changes:**
- Character creation with race (Human, Elf, Dwarf) and class (Warrior, Mage, Ranger) selection, appearance customization, and skill trees
- 3D open world environment using React Three Fiber with four biomes (forest, mountain, dungeon, city), day-night cycle, and dynamic weather system
- Real-time combat with basic attacks, combo system, special abilities with cooldowns, and ultimate skills with charge meters
- Quest system with main storyline and side quests, choice-driven dialogue affecting story outcomes and NPC relationships
- Multiplayer features: cooperative party mode for boss battles, guild system with member management and chat, player trading, and guild wars
- Resource gathering from environment and crafting system to create weapons, armor, and potions
- Player-driven marketplace for trading items between players
- In-app store for cosmetic items, battle passes, and premium membership
- Seasonal events with limited-time quests and rewards, daily login rewards with streak tracking, and rotating daily/weekly challenges
- Fantasy RPG visual theme with medieval-inspired UI, mystical color palette (emerald greens, deep purples, gold accents), and ornate borders

**User-visible outcome:** Players can create customized fantasy characters, explore a vast 3D open world with dynamic weather and day/night cycles, engage in real-time combat with combos and special abilities, complete main and side quests with meaningful choices, team up with friends for cooperative boss battles, join guilds to trade and participate in guild wars, gather resources and craft items, buy and sell on the player marketplace, purchase cosmetic items, and participate in seasonal events and daily challenges.
