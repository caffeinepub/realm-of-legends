  "summary": "The implementation covers core infrastructure (authentication, character creation, quests, guilds, marketplace, crafting, store with Stripe) and basic 3D world rendering. However, many detailed gameplay systems are missing or incomplete, including combat mechanics, skill trees, weather, day-night cycle, multiplayer features, trading, guild wars, resource gathering, seasonal events, daily rewards, and challenges. Visual customization and UI theming are partially implemented.",
